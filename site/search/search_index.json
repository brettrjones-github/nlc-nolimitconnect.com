Jones, and NoLimitConnect has been a long-term passion project that I have been developing on my own for many years. While I continue to work full-time, my professional environment strongly discourages any form of social networking activity \u2014 even on personal time \u2014 which puts me in a unique and somewhat ironic position as the developer of a social platform.</p> <p>Because of this, I am looking for someone who would be interested in becoming the public-facing representative of the NoLimitConnect project. If you are willing to help with community outreach, user support, or general project visibility, you can reach me at:</p>
