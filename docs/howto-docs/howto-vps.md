## VPS Services Used by the NLC Public Network Host

NLC currently uses VPS services from the providers listed below.

### ExtraVM

At the time of writing, the VPS costs **$28.00/month** and includes:

- **8 GB (8192 MB) RAM**
- **4 CPU cores**
- **120 GB storage**

This hardware configuration is excessive for simply hosting an NLC Network Host, but it was selected to provide acceptable performance for developing and compiling NoLimitConnect directly on the VPS.  
For hosting an NLC Network Host only, **approximately half of this hardware would be more than sufficient**.

**ExtraVM features:**

- Unlimited network traffic (no surprise charges if traffic increases)
- Full user control over backups and restores

### Black.host

Black.host is an acceptable VPS provider, but it is **not preferred**.

> **Note:** There is no need to use multiple VPS services. The amount of traffic generated by the Connection Test Service is very small.

## Purchasing a VPS Service

### Minimum Requirements
- At least **1 CPU core**
- At least **2 GB RAM**
- An assigned **static IP address**  
  (Standard for most VPS services, but always verify)
- A **Linux distribution with a desktop interface**  
  (Ubuntu is preferred due to extensive testing and support)
- Ability to install and compile using **Flatpak**  
  (Most Linux distributions support this, including Raspberry Pi)

Please choose your VPS carefully.  
The VPS services used by NoLimitConnect may **not** be suitable if your primary goal is the lowest possible cost.

A good starting point for VPS research is to ask:

## Set Up a Linux Distribution on Your VPS
Depending on the VPS provider, the operating system may already be installed for you.

## (Optional) Purchase a Domain Name

Purchasing a domain name is optional and recommended only if you expect to change your NLC Network Host in the future.
Using a domain name prevents the need to resend network invites if your host’s IP address changes.
