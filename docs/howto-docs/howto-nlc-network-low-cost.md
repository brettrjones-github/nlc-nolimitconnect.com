# How to Set Up a Low-Cost NLC Network

## Choose a Device to Host the NLC Network

The host device can be almost any **64-bit system**, with the exception of **Apple devices**.

If you only have an Apple device and it supports virtualization, you can install **Ubuntu** in a virtual machine and run NLC from there.

If you do not currently have a suitable device, a **Raspberry Pi 5** is a good low-cost hardware option.

### Using a VPS Instead of Local Hardware

As an alternative, you can run NLC on a **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** using Ubuntu.

This option is ideal if:

- You want a **24/7 available host**.
- You experience **frequent power or internet outages**.

The downside is that a VPS is a **paid subscription service**.

If you choose to host on a VPS, it is recommended to follow the high-cost NLC network hosting guide instead:

## Purchase a Fixed or Static IP Address

While there are multiple ways to obtain a fixed or static IP address, the recommended option is a **hide.me VPN Premium subscription**.

This plan includes:
- A **Fixed IP address**
- **UPnP support** to open a network port

At the time of writing, the cost was **$9.95/month**, with discounted rates available for longer-term subscriptions.

## (Optional) Purchase a Domain Name

Purchasing a domain name is optional and recommended only if you expect to change your NLC Network Host in the future.

Using a domain name prevents the need to resend network invites if your host’s IP address changes.
