# Fixed IP vs Static IP

## Overview
The terms **Fixed IP** and **Static IP** are often used interchangeably, but they can refer to slightly different concepts depending on the service provider and context. This page explains the characteristics for each.

## What Is a Static IP?
A **Static IP address** is an IP address that does not change over time. It is manually assigned to a device or server and remains constant unless it is deliberately reconfigured.

### Key Characteristics
- Does not change
- Usually manually configured

---

## What Is a Fixed IP?
A **Fixed IP address** is an IP address that is consistently assigned to the same customer or device by a service provider. While it typically remains the same, it is managed by the provider rather than manually configured by the user and may change.

### Key Characteristics
- Assigned and managed by an ISP or service provider
- Remains the same under normal conditions

## How are these typically used by NLC?

A fixed or static IP is only needed if you are hosting a NLC Network (not needed for Group, ChatRoom and Random Connect hosting)

If you host on a VPS then the VPS provider will assign a static IP to your VPS.

If you host on a device then it is recommended to use the Fixed IP feature of hide.me VPN

There are other ways to get a fixed or static IP but they tend to be complex and expensive.
