## What Is a Virtual Private Server (VPS)?

A **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** is a virtual machine that runs on a physical server and behaves like a dedicated computer, even though it shares hardware with other VPS instances.

### How a VPS Works

A powerful physical server is divided into multiple **isolated virtual servers** using virtualization technology. Each VPS:

- Has its **own operating system** (such as Ubuntu)
- Is allocated **dedicated CPU, RAM, and storage**
- Runs independently from other VPS instances on the same hardware

From your perspective, a VPS functions just like a standalone computer that you fully control.

### Why Use a VPS?

A VPS is commonly used when you need:

- **24/7 availability**
- A **stable internet connection**
- A **public static IP address**
- The ability to **host services accessible from anywhere**

This makes VPS hosting ideal for services like an **NLC Network Host**.
