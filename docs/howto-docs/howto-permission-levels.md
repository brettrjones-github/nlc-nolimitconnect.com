# Permission Levels Explained

Permission Levels are how you control who has access to what.

From Highest to Lowest Access these permission Levels are:

1. **Administrator** ![Administrator](../assets/howto/icon-admin.png)

2. **Friend** ![Friend](../assets/howto/icon-friend.png) or ![FriendJoined](../assets/howto/icon-friend-joined.png)  
   Can access any Shared Plugin Resources set to Permission Level Friend, Guest or Anybody 


3. **Guest** ![Guest](../assets/howto/icon-guest.png)  
   Can access any Shared Plugin Resources set to Permission Level Guest or Anybody  
   *NOTE: people that join the host you are joined to are automatically elevated from Anybody to Guest if you have not set a permission level for that person*

4. **Anybody** ![Anybody](../assets/howto/icon-anybody.png)  
   Can only access Shared Plugin Resources set to Permission Level Anybody 

5. **Ignore** ![Ignore](../assets/howto/icon-ignore.png)
    Can **NOT** access anything and if a attempt of direct connect to you then that connection is immediately dropped. 

If a plugin is set to Disabled or ignored then that plugin is completely disabled.
