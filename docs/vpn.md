Using any VPN greatly improves your privacy.
Your IP Address gives any site you connect to your location and a way to track you.
A VPN presents it's IP Address to the internet and hides your actual IP Address.

Using Hide.me VPN (Premium Subscription) can greatly improve connectivity in NoLimitConnect, especially when your network or ISP restricts incoming ports.  
Hide.me VPN is one of the few VPN providers that fully supports:

- **Automatic Port Forwarding via UPnP**
- **Practically all Operating Systems (Including Raspberry Pi)**
- **IPv6 Support**
- **Fixed IP Addresses**
- **OpenVPN & WireGuard**
- **Strict No-Logs Policy**

These features make Hide.me an ideal choice for users who want direct connections without configuring routers manually.

# 🛡 Why a VPN Helps With NoLimitConnect

Some Internet service providers:

- Block inbound traffic  
- Use Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)  
- Prevent manual port forwarding  
- Provide restrictive NAT types  

When this happens, NoLimitConnect must use a **relay** instead of a direct connection.

A VPN with port forwarding can solve this by:

- Giving you an externally accessible port  
- Providing a consistent, open NAT  
- Allowing direct peer connections  
- Improving performance and hosting reliability
