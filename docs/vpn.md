# Recommended VPN: Hide.me

Using a VPN can greatly improve connectivity in NoLimitConnect, especially when your network or ISP restricts incoming ports.  
Hide.me VPN is one of the few VPN providers that fully supports:

- **Automatic Port Forwarding**
- **UPnP**
- **OpenVPN & WireGuard**
- **Strict No-Logs Policy**

These features make Hide.me an ideal choice for users who want direct connections without configuring routers manually.

# 🛡 Why a VPN Helps With NoLimitConnect

Some Internet service providers:

- Block inbound traffic  
- Use Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)  
- Prevent manual port forwarding  
- Provide restrictive NAT types  

When this happens, NoLimitConnect must use a **relay** instead of a direct connection.

A VPN with port forwarding can solve this by:

- Giving you an externally accessible port  
- Providing a consistent, open NAT  
- Allowing direct peer connections  
- Improving performance and hosting reliability
