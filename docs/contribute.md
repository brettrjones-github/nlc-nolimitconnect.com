# Contributing

My name is Brett R. Jones, and NoLimitConnect is a long-term passion project that I have been building independently for many years. I continue to work full-time, and while I’m deeply committed to developing this platform, my professional environment strongly discourages any form of social networking activity — even outside of work. 

This creates an ironic situation for a developer of a social platform:  
I can build the system, but I cannot effectively participate in the public-facing side of it.

Because of this, I am looking for someone who would be interested in serving as a **community-facing representative** for the NoLimitConnect project. If you’re passionate about privacy, decentralized communication, or open-source communities, your help would be incredibly valuable.

You can contact me at:

### Possible Responsibilities

- Setting up or moderating community chat channels  
- Helping organize bug tracking and user feedback  
- Acting as a representative of the project while respecting its privacy-focused mission  
- Assisting with documentation, onboarding guides, or release announcements  

### Project Principles

- Absolutely **no advertising or spam**, with the single exception of Hide.me VPN (recommended for users needing automatic port forwarding).  
- The project will remain privacy-first and user-controlled — no analytics, tracking, or monetization that compromises user autonomy.

Any level of involvement — whether technical, social, or organizational — is appreciated.  
Your support can help ensure the long-term growth and success of NoLimitConnect.
