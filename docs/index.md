!!! tip "Need Direct Connections Without Router Configuration?"
    If your ISP blocks ports or uses strict NAT, you can still get **green direct-connect status** by using a VPN that supports automatic port forwarding.

    **Hide.me VPN** offers:  
    - Automatic port forwarding  
    - UPnP support  
    - Direct connection even behind CGNAT  
    - Strong privacy with a strict no-logs policy
