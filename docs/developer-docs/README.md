## Contributing

My name is Brett R. Jones, and NoLimitConnect has been a long-term passion project that I have been developing on my own for many years. While I continue to work full-time, my professional environment strongly discourages any form of social networking activity — even on personal time — which puts me in a unique and somewhat ironic position as the developer of a social platform.

Because of this, I am looking for someone who would be interested in becoming the public-facing representative of the NoLimitConnect project. If you are willing to help with community outreach, user support, or general project visibility, you can reach me at:

**bjones.engineer(AT)gmail.com**

### Responsibilities may include:

- Setting up and maintaining community chat channels  
- Helping organize bug tracking or a central place for user feedback  
- Acting as a project representative while respecting the project’s privacy and mission  

### Notes:

- No advertising or spam is allowed (with the exception of hide.me VPN, which is recommended for port forwarding).  
- If the project ever receives meaningful donations, I am fully open to sharing them with contributors who help move the project forward.

Your involvement — whether small or large — would be greatly appreciated and will help ensure the long-term growth of NoLimitConnect.
