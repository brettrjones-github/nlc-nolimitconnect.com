        <h1 class="section-title">VPN's with Port Forward Feature</h1>

        <p>Use of a VPN is recommended for anyone who uses the internet. In some goverments you are your IP address. No real proof required.<br>
        Port Forwarding is not required for users who will never host anything but it will speed up connections and data transfer between users.<br>
        Port Forwarding or a Open Port is required for uses who host a user provided service.<br>
        A Open Port and a static IP is required in most cases for uses who host a separate No Limit Connect network.</p>

        <p>Here is some VPN services that offer a port forwarding feature:<br>
        Most VPN providers do not provide port forwarding or require a dedicated router etc. <br>
        Beware of fake reviews etc. A VPN that is claimed to be best for torrenting does not mean it allows port forwarding.</p>

        <p>1.) Hide.me: Supports Up to 10 dynamic port forwards.<br>
        4.3 rating on android play store<br>
        Static IP available Yes<br>
        The author of No Limit Connect recommends Hide.me because<br>
         a.) User does not have to setup port forwarding. Port forwarding is done automatically through UPNP protocol which hide.me vpn supports.<br>
         b.) Hide.me is low cost and even offers free accounts (although the free account is limited).<br>
         c.) Hide.me supports IPv6 Internet Protocol.
         d.) The author of No Limit Connect gets a bit of money if you buy hide.me VPN using the advertisement below.<br>
