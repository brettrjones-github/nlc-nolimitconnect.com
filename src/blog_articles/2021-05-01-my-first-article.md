description: My first attempt to publish.

I chose flathub for publishing to Linux distributions.

Flathub https://flathub.org is a modern way to destribute Linux applications. You publish once to flathub and it will make your application available to many Linux distributions including Ubuntu and Rasberry PI.

Like all build systems there is complexity and a language of sorts just for that build system. I think I have spent more time setting up build enviroments and dependencies than I have actually writting code. I found flathub/flatpak system to be one of the easier ones.

The verdict is still out as to if my submission is accepted, however, they have been more responsive than I expected and have helped me make corrections. I am hoping to hear good news soon.
