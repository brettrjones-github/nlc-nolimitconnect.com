# About NoLimitConnect

NoLimitConnect is a decentralized, user-hosted social platform designed to give people full control over their communication, media, and personal data.

Unlike traditional social networks, NoLimitConnect does not rely on central servers or third-party providers. Instead, users form direct peer-to-peer connections, resulting in a platform that is:

- **Privacy-focused** – Your data stays with you.  
- **Censorship-resistant** – No single authority controls the network.  
- **Fully user-hosted** – Connections are between peers, not through corporate datacenters.  
- **Cross-platform** – Works across Windows, Linux, Android, Docker, and more.

## Project Goals

- Build a truly decentralized platform for communication  
- Protect user privacy without requiring trust in corporations  
- Enable user-controlled hosting and direct peer connections  
- Offer modern social features without compromising security  
- Provide open-source transparency and community-driven growth

## Why It Matters

Modern social networks are centralized, heavily monitored, and financially motivated to collect user data.  
NoLimitConnect provides an alternative — one where users remain in control of their identity, their content, and their conversations.
